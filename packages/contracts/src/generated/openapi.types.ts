         *     operator's button, an API test or the demo payment robot.
         *
         *     On acceptance Billing records the payment, moves the invoice
         *     `issued → paid`, appends a `release` ledger entry and emits
         *     `payment.received.v1` **followed by** `credit.released.v1` in that order

         *     `paymentReference` in the request body **is** the idempotency key
         *     (invariant B10, R48). It is a property of the remittance itself — the
         *     bank's reference — not a transport header, which is why it lives in the
         *     body and why it works identically for the operator, a test and a robot.
         *
         *     | Situation | Status | Body |
         *     |---|---|---|
         *     | Unseen `paymentReference`, amount and currency match the invoice total | `201` | `outcome: accepted` |
         *     | **Same** `paymentReference` replayed against the **same** invoice with the **same** amount | `200` | `outcome: duplicate` — the **original** outcome, byte-for-byte; no second payment recorded, **no second fact emitted** |
         *     | Same `paymentReference` reused for a **different** invoice or a different amount | `409` | `PAYMENT_REFERENCE_REUSED` — the key is being used to mean two different things |
         *     | Invoice already `paid`, remittance arrives under a **different** `paymentReference` | `409` | `INVOICE_ALREADY_PAID` — nothing changes (R49) |
         *     | Amount or currency differs from the invoice total | `422` | `PAYMENT_MISMATCH` — partial and over-payment are out of scope; nothing changes (R49) |
         *
         *     A `200` and a `201` therefore differ only in whether *this* call was the
         *     one that changed the world. Clients must treat both as success — a
         *     retrying robot that saw a dropped connection will legitimately get
         *     `200` for a payment it made itself.

         *     the client never sends anything back on it, which is why an SSE stream
         *     rather than a bidirectional socket.
         *
         *     ### Frame format
         *
         *     Each frame is a standard SSE block:
         *
         *     ```
         *     id: 1755511234567-17
         *     event: order.updated
         *     data: {"orderId":"…","status":"confirmed", …}
         *
         *     ```
         *
         *     - `event` names the event type. The types emitted are listed below.
         *     - `data` is a single-line JSON document whose schema depends on `event`.
         *     - `id` is an opaque, monotonically increasing cursor.
         *
         *     ### Event types
         *
         *     | `event` | `data` schema | Meaning |
         *     |---|---|---|
         *     | `order.updated` | `OrderStreamUpdate` | A read-model document changed — status, references or totals |
         *     | `timeline.appended` | `TimelineStreamEntry` | One fact was appended to an order's timeline |
         *     | `stream.ready` | `StreamReady` | Sent once on connect, carrying the cursor the stream resumed from |
         *     | `ping` | `StreamPing` | Keep-alive, sent on an idle interval so proxies do not close the connection |
         *
         *     ### Reconnection
         *
         *     On reconnect the client sends the id of the last frame it processed in
         *     the `Last-Event-ID` request header (browsers do this automatically), and
         *     the stream **resumes after that cursor** from a bounded replay buffer.
         *     Two honest limitations, stated rather than hidden:
         *
         *     1. The buffer is bounded. If the client was away longer than the buffer
         *        holds, the stream replies `stream.ready` with `resumed: false` and
         *        the client must re-fetch `GET /orders/{id}` (or `GET /orders`) to
         *        resynchronise. The stream is a *notification* channel; the read model
         *        is the source of truth.
         *     2. Delivery is at-least-once. A frame may repeat after a reconnect, so
         *        clients deduplicate on the `eventId` inside `data` — the same
         *        discipline every fact consumer applies (R51).
